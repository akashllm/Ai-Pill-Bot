PillPal – A Medication Query Bot Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
PillPal is an intelligent Telegram bot and website designed to assist users by providing accurate, real-time information about medications based on Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) or drug guides.
This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), combining the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector-based search to deliver precise answers by extracting relevant content from uploaded PDFs. 
 Users can upload medication guides, and PillPal breaks these documents into manageable chunks, embeds them using FAISS for similarity search, and retrieves context-rich responses to user queries. 
 The solution is built on top of Langchain with seamless integrations from tools like PyMuPDFLoader for PDF management and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for chunking strategies that ensure fine-grained retrieval. 
 The RAG pipeline consists of several key components, including a retriever, prompt templates, and an LLM chain, ensuring smooth interaction between the query and the document data. 
 The project also includes a flexible cosine similarity-based search with options to implement hybrid models for exact matches, making it adaptable to different use cases. 
PillPal exemplifies how advanced AI, semantic search, and language models can work together to offer meaningful solutions to real-world challenges.
This end-to-end framework is ready for customization and further development, ensuring that the system evolves to meet the diverse needs of users, whether for healthcare providers, pharmacists, or everyday users seeking reliable drug information.
